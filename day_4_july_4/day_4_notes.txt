Javascript
==========
-dynamically typed , Synchronous & single-threaded Programming Language.
-dynamically typed means the types are checked, and datatype mismatches are spotted only at the runtime.
-JavaScript engine executes code from top to bottom, line by line.In other words, it is synchronous.
-JavaScript engine has only one 'call-stack' so that it only can do one thing at a time.

-To Run Javascript code, no external software(compiler) needs to be installed
-A JavaScript engine is a program or an interpreter which executes JavaScript code. 
  

javascript Engines:
	V8  - is developed by Google , Google Chrome.
	SpiderMonkey - is developed by Mozilla , Firefox.
	JavaScriptCore  - is Apple's engine for its Safari browser. 
	Chakra  - is the JavaScript engine of the Internet Explorer browser.




Types
------
1. internal
	a. <script></script>	
	b. head or body
	c. page level javascript
	
2. external
	a. separate js file(needs to be included to html)
		<script src='abc.js'></script>	
	b. head or body
	c. Application level/project level

	
Q. What is the best place to include js files? 
   head/body?

-If a Javascript file is not manipulating the DOM elements, js can be kept in <head>
-if a Javascript file is manipulating the DOM elements, js cann't be kept in <head> 


Eliminate Render-Blocking JavaScript
====================================
-With HTML5, we got two new boolean attributes for the <script> tag : async and defer.
 ex:- <script src='demo.js' async/defer></script>
-async/defer attribute should only be used on external scripts, not with internal scripts.
-These attributes only make sense while using the script in the head portion of the page.
-async attribute ensures that the JavaScript file is loaded asynchronously in the background and does not block rendering.
-defer attribute tells the browser to run the script after the document has been parsed
-With async, the file gets downloaded asynchronously and then executed as soon as itâ€™s downloaded.
-With defer, the file gets downloaded asynchronously, but executed only when the document parsing is completed.
-With defer, scripts will execute in the same order as they are called. 
 defer is useful when a script depends on another script.

1. No defer or no async,script in the head
2. No defer or no async,script in the body
3. With async attribute,script in the head
4. With defer attribute,script in the head

parse HTML - 2sec
fetch js   - 1sec
execute js   - 1sec
