function closure
================
-A closure is an inner function that has access to its outer function's variables even after the outer function's execution is Completed/Closed.

-When the outer function execution completes, you’d expect all its variables to be no longer accessible. However, if the inner function uses variables from the outer function, those variables remain accessible.

-The inner function retains access to the outer function’s scope, because the inner function ‘remembers’ the environment in which it was created.

-An outer function will never have 'closure' scope

-An inner function will not have 'closure' scope, if the inner function is not accessing outer function variables.
